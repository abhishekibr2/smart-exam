                        It is long perceived that selective schools provide students with
                        excellent education without the exorbitant fees normally found in
                        private grammar schools.
                    </p>
                    <p className="p-xxl color-deep-blue mb-0">
                        Selective schools are public schools. There is $0 tuition fee but the a
                        school may ask for a voluntary contribution which you pay if you want
                        to. These usually range from $500 - $2000. As a former MacRobertson
                        Girls High School student, I can say that the school is life-changing.
                        My friends who went to the school have become surgeons, doctors,
                        dentists and lawyers. So more importantly, how can your child get into
                        one of these selective schools and how can YOU help set them up for a
                        secure and successful future?

                    <p className="p-xxl color-deep-blue mb-0">
                        The answer is simple. To get into Melbourne High, MacRobertson Girls&apos;
                        High School, Suzanne Cory and Nossal, your child needs to ace the
                        Victorian Selective Schools Entrance Exam held around June each year.
                    </p>

                        To help your child gain a school offer, you should get help for your
                        child to prepare for the test. With over 3,000 students trying to get a
                        school spot – the competition is fierce. When so much is on the line, it
                        makes sense to get help.
